Elm is a pure functional programming language that compiles to JavaScript.

- Elm is statically typed. But it has type inference, so it is not necessary to manually write the types.

- All functions are pure. Meaning that given the same arguments they always return the same result.

- All data is immutable. Functions always return a new version of the data instead of mutating the data given.

- There is no null in Elm. Instead in Elm we represent the absence of a value by using a type called Maybe.
