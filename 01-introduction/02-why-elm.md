# Why Elm?

## Safe and Robust

It is very hard to get runtime errors in Elm. This is possible because of the great type system and the abscence of null. So programs in Elm are more robust.

## Better errors handling

In JavaScript is easy to ignore possible errors. You can do this in Elm. The compiler pushes us to explicitly thing about all possible results of an operation.

## A great type system

All core and third party packages in Elm conform to the Elm type system. This means that the compiler can catch all type issues (unlike TypeScript or Flow).

## Confident refactoring experience

Because of the robust type system refactoring a program in Elm is much easier. The compiler will tell us all places that a change affects.

## Less setup

There is a lot to setup and decide when building an Elm project.

## Easier to test

Pure functions means that they are easier to test as they don't rely on side effects. Building a whole program from pure functions means that overall it is easier to test.

## Guaranteed immutable data

Elm has only one way to update data. It doesn't let us do the wrong thing, which is easy in JS if we are not careful.

## Terse functional programming

If you like **lodash**, **ramda** or **sanctuary**, Elm offers a much terser syntax for functional programming, which includes partial application and the pipe operator.
