# What is Elm?

Elm is a pure functional programming language that compiles to JavaScript.

Some key concepts of Elm are:

- Elm is statically typed. But it has type inference, so it is not necessary to write the types for everything.
- All functions are pure: Meaning that given the same arguments they always return the same result.
- All data is immutable. Functions always return a new version of the data instead of mutating the data given.
- There is no null in Elm. Instead in Elm we represent the absence of a value using a type called Maybe.
